<h2>Naming variables</h2>
<html><body><p>As you know, each <strong>variable</strong> has a unique<strong> name</strong> that identifies it among other variables. Setting a good variable name may not be as easy as it seems. Experienced developers pay a lot of attention to names to make their programs easy to understand. It is important because programmers spend a lot of time reading and understanding code written by other developers. If the variables aren't named well, then even your own code may seem unclear to you after a few months. This is not good, because programming is not only about writing programs, but also about their further support and development.</p>
<p>In this topic, we will take a closer look at how to select nice names for your variables according to the agreements and practices established in the JavaScript community.</p>
<h5 id="restrictions" style="text-align: center;">Restrictions</h5>
<p>There are no specific requirements for characters that can be used in JavaScript to create names. However, there are two restrictions that you can easily remember: a name can only consist of letters, numbers, and symbols <code class="language-javascript">_</code>, <code class="language-javascript">$</code>; and it shouldn't start with a digit.</p>
<p>Look at the examples below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let $testName; // right
let testName;  // right
let test_name; // right
let test18;    // right
let test;      // right

let 18test;    // wrong
let test-name; // wrong</code></pre>
<p>A hyphen <code class="language-javascript">-</code> is <em>not</em> a valid character for variable names in JS.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">In JS, the case of the characters matters, so <code class="language-javascript">firstName</code> and <code class="language-javascript">firstname</code> will be different variables.</div><p></p>
<h5 id="reserved-names" style="text-align: center;">Reserved names</h5>
<p>Reserved names cannot be used when selecting a variable name. These are words that already perform specific functions in Javascript. These words include: <em>let</em>, <em>const</em>, <em>return,</em> and <em>function</em>. The complete list of words that are reserved can be found on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MDN</a>.</p>
<p>The code below returns a syntactical error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let const = 5;          // error
let return = "apple";   // error </code></pre>
<h5 id="naming-conventions-for-variables" style="text-align: center;">Naming conventions for variables</h5>
<p>In addition, there are the following conventions for naming variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>The variable name must be readable, descriptive, and it should explain to the reader what sort of values it stores. For example:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let count;  // good name
let n;      // bad name</code></pre>
<p>Coming up with such names — short and precise — becomes easier with experience, but only if you put some work in it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite the validity of the underscore <code class="language-javascript">_</code> symbol, most style guides recommend opting for camelCase to write a name consisting of several words. <strong>camelCase</strong> is a way of writing phrases where each new word in the middle of the phrase begins with a capital letter, without intermediate spaces or punctuation marks:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let serverMessage; // the variable name is written according to camelCase practice</code></pre>
<p>These conventions are optional, but it is strongly recommended to follow them. As we've mentioned at the beginning of this lesson, they make your code more readable for you and other JavaScript programmers.</p></body></html>
