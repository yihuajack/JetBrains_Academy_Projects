<h2>Null and Undefined</h2>
<p>In JavaScript, there are two special data types to indicate the absence of a value: <code class="language-javascript">null</code> and <code class="language-javascript">undefined</code>. One might think, why would there be special data types to indicate what is not there, and why two of them? Well, in JS, things are not so simple. In this topic, we will figure out the difference between <code class="language-javascript">null</code> and <code class="language-javascript">undefined</code>, and learn when they are used.</p>

<h5 id="null" style="text-align: center;"><em>null</em></h5>

<p><code class="language-javascript">null</code> means that the variable was explicitly assigned an empty or non-existent value. If the variable is <code class="language-javascript">null</code>, we know that it does not contain an acceptable number, string or other data type:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let name = null; 
console.log(name); // null</code></pre>

<p>The example above shows that the variable <code class="language-javascript">name</code> is unknown or for some reason does not have a value.</p>

<h5 id="undefined" style="text-align: center;"><em>undefined</em></h5>

<p>The <code class="language-javascript">undefined</code> value is returned when a variable was declared, but its value wasn't set. Let's consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let count; 
console.log(count); // undefined </code></pre>

<p>Here, as expected, the <code class="language-javascript">undefined</code> value was output to the console.</p>

<p><code class="language-javascript">undefined</code> may also occur in cases when object properties do not exist:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">let person = {
  age: 27
};

console.log(person.name); // undefined</code></pre>

<p>In this case, <code class="language-javascript">undefined</code> is returned because we tried to output to the console a property <code class="language-javascript">name</code> that wasn't specified in our object.</p>

<p>But that's not all! The <code class="language-javascript">undefined</code> value is also returned when a function has a missing parameter:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function getDetails(a) {
  console.log(a);
}

getDetails(); // undefined</code></pre>

<p>In the example above, <code class="language-javascript">undefined</code> is printed because the parameter <code class="language-javascript">a</code> was missing in the written function.</p>

<h5 id="check-the-data-types" style="text-align: center;">Check the data types</h5>

<p><code class="language-javascript">null</code> and <code class="language-javascript">undefined</code> literally mean "no value",  but they have different data types:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(typeof null);       // object
console.log(typeof undefined);  // undefined</code></pre>

<p>You expected that type <code class="language-javascript">null</code> would return <code class="language-javascript">null</code>, didn't you? </p>

<p>You were right if you thought so. In fact, <code class="language-javascript">null</code> is not an object, but a separate data type. This strange behavior is an officially recognized error in the language. The mistake has existed for several decades. The reason no one fixes it is that thousands of sites created in JavaScript depend on this kind of wrong behavior. Fixing this bug can lead to many sites and popular web applications crashing. That's why we have nothing else to do but remember this peculiarity of the language and take it into account when writing scripts. We will talk more about objects as a separate type of data next time.</p>

<h5 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5>

<p>Good job! Now you know what <code class="language-javascript">null</code> and <code class="language-javascript">undefined</code> have in common. You also know about the differences between these values and their weird features. Try not to abuse these data types: use them wisely, and you can avoid many mistakes in your programs.</p>
