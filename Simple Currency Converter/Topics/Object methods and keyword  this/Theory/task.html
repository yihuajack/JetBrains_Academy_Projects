<h2>Object methods and keyword "this"</h2>
<html><body><p>When writing scripts, we usually need to create objects to present something from the real world: users, products, maps, and more. In real life, it is possible to consider the products in detail or put something in a shopping cart; it's also an option in programming. Such actions in JavaScript are available thanks to <strong>object</strong> <strong>methods</strong>, meaning the functions you can use as object properties.</p>
<h5 id="object-method-creation" style="text-align: center;">Object method creation</h5>
<p>Let's try to understand how object methods are created. To do this, consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let product = {
  name: "Microwave",
  description: "With oven mode",
  price: 398
};

product.giveDiscount = function() {
  console.log("You have a 10% discount!");
};

product.giveDiscount(); // You have a 10% discount!</code></pre>
<p>In this code, we have allowed the object to report a discount on the product by writing the method <code class="language-javascript">giveDiscount</code>.</p>
<h5 id="shortened-recording" style="text-align: center;">Shortened recording</h5>
<p>There's a shorter way of setting functions as properties. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let person = {
  greetings: function() {
    console.log("Hello");
  }
};</code></pre>
<p>We can also skip the keyword <code class="language-javascript">function</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let person = {
  greetings() {
    console.log("Hello");
  }
};</code></pre>
<p>Shortened syntax not only saves you time but also makes the code more readable.</p>
<h5 id="this-keyword" style="text-align: center;"><em>"this"</em> keyword</h5>
<p>In natural language, we can point to a specific person, animal, or object using pronouns. In JavaScript you may just as well refer to a specific object using the keyword <code class="language-javascript">this</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let user = {
  firstName: "Elliot",
  lastName: "Alderson",
  fullName() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
}; 

console.log(user.fullName()); // Elliot Alderson</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, with the help of <code class="language-javascript">this</code>, the <code class="language-javascript">fullName</code> function has accessed the <code class="language-javascript">firstName</code> and <code class="language-javascript">lastName</code> information stored in the <code class="language-javascript">user</code> object, because it is declared inside it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">Applying <code class="language-javascript">this</code> to nested objects can create some confusion. In such situations, you should keep it in mind that the keyword <code class="language-javascript">this</code> refers to the object in whose method it is used.</div>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="this-and-arrow-functions" style="text-align: center;"><em>"this"</em> and arrow functions</h5>
<p>Arrow functions <em>cannot</em> bind <code class="language-javascript">this</code>. In other words, the arrow functions do not have their own <code class="language-javascript">this</code>.</p>
<p>If we use <code class="language-javascript">this</code> inside an arrow function, its value is taken from an external function declared the usual way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let movie = {
  name: "The Thirteenth Floor",
  year: 1999,
  getInfo() {
    let arrow = () =&gt; console.log("The movie " + this.name + " was shot in " + this.year);
    arrow();
  }
}; 

movie.getInfo(); // The movie The Thirteenth Floor was shot in 1999</code></pre>
<p>In fact, the specifics of using <code class="language-javascript">this</code> in JavaScript are not limited to the examples described above. Here we've covered only the basics of working with this keyword, so there's a lot more to learn.</p></body></html>
